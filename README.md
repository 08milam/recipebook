Each note has a unique identifier (user email), the user's email (linking it to the User entity), a title, the content of the note itself, a date (presumably the date the note was created or last modified), and a recipe id (which suggests that notes can be associated with specific recipes).

- GET https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/random
- When you make a GET request to this endpoint, you're essentially asking the Spoonacular API to provide you with a random recipe. This could be any recipe from their database, selected at random by the API's algorithm.

In practical terms, when you send this GET request, your client (such as a web browser, a mobile app, or a script) communicates with Spoonacular's server. Spoonacular's server then processes the request, selects a random recipe from its database, and returns the details of that recipe in a structured format, typically in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
